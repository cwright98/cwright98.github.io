<body>This graph shows the maximum temperature of a city plotted against the latitude of said city (all recorded in January). Latitude is the north-south measurement of the earth, so on the graph where you see "0" latitude, it refers to cities very near or level with 
    the equator. This graph nicely illustrates that the closer a city gets to the equator, the warmer it will be on average.
