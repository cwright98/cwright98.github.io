<body> The third graph plots the % cloudiness of a city's sky on against the latitude of the city. While the graph does not indicate any sort of trend between latitudes and humidity, it does show that there is 
    a slight "all or nothing" trend with cloudiness. The majority of percentages of cloudiness were either less than 20 or greater than 65. There were of course observations in between, but there appears to be a higher concentration of observations in these outside ranges..
